# HiRoots Property Showing Automation System

A comprehensive n8n-based automation system that streamlines the property showing coordination process for rental properties. This system manages lead qualification, availability coordination, and appointment scheduling between leads, property owners/tenants, and showing agents.

## 🎯 Overview

1. **Lead Qualification** - Automatically qualifies leads based on credit score, income, pet policies, and move-in dates
2. **Contact Management** - Creates and syncs contacts between GoHighLevel (GHL) and Airtable
3. **Form Generation** - Dynamically generates Tally forms for availability collection using AI
4. **Availability Coordination** - Collects and matches availability from leads, property owners/tenants, and agents
5. **Appointment Booking** - Automatically books appointments in GHL calendar when all parties confirm
6. **Smart Reminders** - Sends automated reminders to ensure form completion
7. **Race Condition Handling** - Manages concurrent form submissions from multiple agents
